    "To show how to solve your quadratic program using a quantum computer, we will use two algorithms to solve the crop-yield problem. It is a common need to optimise the crops and management of a farm to reduce risk while increasing profits. One of the big challenges facing Africa and the whole world is how to produce enough food for everyone. The problem here focuses not on profits but on the tonnage of crops harvested. Imagine you have a farm with three hectares of land suitable for farming. You need to choose which crops to plant from a selection of four. Furthermore, you also need to determine how many hectares of each you should lant. The four crops you can plant are wheat, soybeans, maize, and a push-pull crop. The fourth cannot be sold once harvested but it can help increase the yield of the other crops.\n",

This is can make the farm susceptible to disease and pests as the entire yield would be affected. In some instances, growing two different plants nearby each other will increase the yield of both, though sometimes it can decrease the yield. Intercropping is the process where different plants are chosen to _increase_ the yield. Push-Pull crops are pairs of plants that repel pests and attract pests respectively. Integrating them into a larger farm increases the yield of harvested food but with the cost of not necessarily being able to use the harvest of Push-Pull crops as part of the total yield.

In their general sense, they are NP-Hard; a class of problems that is difficult to solve using classical computational methods. In fact, the best classical method to solve these problems involves heuristics, a technique that finds an approximate solution. Quantum Computers have been shown to provide significant speed-up and better scaling for some heuristic problems. The crop-yield problem is a combinatorial problem, in that the solution is a specific combination of input parameters.

    "## 5. Solving the Crop-Yield Problem\n",
    "There are three ways to _run_ a quantum algorithm using Qiskit:\n",
    "1. on a simulator locally on your own machine\n",
    "2. on a simulator hosted in the cloud by IBM\n",
    "3. on an actual quantum computer accessible through IBM Quantum.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these are called backends. In all cases, the _backend_ can easily be swapped for another as long as the simulator or device has appropriate resources (number of qubits etc.). In the code below, we show how to access different backends. We demonstrate this using the local Aer QASM simulator from Qiskit. The Aer QASM simulator models the physical properties of a real quantum computer so you, researchers, and developers can test their quantum computing code and algorithms before running on real devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "We would like to compare our quantum solution to that obtained classically. Secondly, we also want to try different algorithms. The following three subsections show how these different methods for solving the Crop-Yield problem are implemented in Qiskit. The two algorithms used are the [_Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm_](https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.algorithms.QAOA.html?highlight=qaoa#qiskit.algorithms.QAOA) `QAOA` and the [_Variational Quantum Eigensolver_](https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.algorithms.VQE.html?highlight=vqe#qiskit.algorithms.VQE) `VQE`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both of these algorithms are hybrid, in that they use a classical _optimizer_ to alter parameters that affect the quantum computation. The VQE algorithm is used to find the lowest eigenvalue of a matrix, which can describe a system to optimize. The QAOA also finds the lowest eigenvalue, but achieves this is a different way to VQE. Both are very popular algorithms, with varying applications and strengths.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classical Solution\n",
    "The classical solution to the crop-yield problem can easily be found using Numpy and Qiskit. The QUBO problem can be solved by finding the minimum eigenvalue of its underlying matrix representation. Fortunately, we don't have to know what this matrix looks like. We only need to pass it to a `MinimumEigensolver` and `MinimumEigenOptimizer`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimizer translates the provided problem into a parameterised representation which is then passed to the solver. By optimizing the paramters, the solver will eventually give the minimum eigenvalue for the parameterized representation and thus the solution to the original problem.

The QAOA is an iterative algorithm, and thus is run multiple times with different internal parameters. The parameters are tuned classically during the optimization step of the computation by `optimizer`. If we leave `optimizer` as `None`, our algorithms will use the default optimization algorithm. To determine how many iterations there are, we define a callback function that runs for each iteration and stores the number of evaluations thus far. At the end of our algorithm execution, we return the result and the number of iterations.\n",

Furthermore, you should see that all devices available through the _open group_ have at most 7 qubits.
